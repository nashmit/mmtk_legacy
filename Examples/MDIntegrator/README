The files in this directory are provided as an illustration of how to
implement molecular dynamics integrators and similar algorithms in
Cython.  The Velocity Verlet integrator provided as an example is
intentionally kept simple; it supports neither fixed atoms nor
distance constraints, and has neither a thermostat nor a barostat.

To compile and link the C module, type

   python setup.py build_ext --inplace

To run the test script, type

   python test.py
